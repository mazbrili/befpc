## OpenBeOS Generic Jamfile v1.0 ##

## Fill in this file to specify the project being created, and the referenced
## Jamfile-engine will do all of the hard work for you.  This handles both
## Intel and PowerPC builds of the (Open)BeOS.

## Application Specific Settings ---------------------------------------------

# Specify the name of the binary
#	If the name has spaces, you must quote it: "My App"
NAME = "libbepascal.so" ;

# Specify the type of binary
#	APP:	Application
#	SHARED:	Shared library or add-on
#	STATIC:	Static library archive
#	DRIVER: Kernel Driver
TYPE = SHARED ;

# Specify the source files to use
#	Full paths or paths relative to the Jamfile can be included.
# 	All files, regardless of directory, will have their object
#	files created in the common object directory.
#	Note that this means this Jamfile will not work correctly
#	if two source files with the same name (source.c or source.cpp)
#	are included from different directories.
# Ex: SRCS = file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp ;

#	be found.  Directories where source files are found are

# (for TYPE == DRIVER only) Specify desired location of driver in the /dev
#	hierarchy. Used by the driverinstall rule. E.g., DRIVER_PATH = video/usb will
#	instruct the driverinstall rule to place a symlink to your driver's binary in
#	~/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/video/usb, so that your driver will appear at
#	/dev/video/usb when loaded. Default is "misc".
